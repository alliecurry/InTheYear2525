<dl><dd><i>[<b>Scene</b>: Animal Clinic Examination Room. Veterinary surgeries haven't changed much in a thousand years; there is a sink, a paper towel dispenser and an examination table in the middle of the room, which Nibbler sits on.

</dd></dl>
<div class="poem">
<p><b>Jeffery</b>: It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.

<div class="poem">
<p><b>Jeffery</b>: OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. <i>[He walks through a door and doesn't close it. Fry, Leela and Bender step back in horror when they hear an animal growling. Jeffery struggles with the growling creature and glass breaks. He flails his legs around and runs back into the examination room. The door closes. His shirt is ripped and blooded and he has a bruised eye.]</i> The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of <i>my</i> teeth out. <i>[He chuckles.]</i> Now then.

</div>
<dl><dd><i>[He pulls out the broken crown of Nibbler's fang and sets it down on a table. Fry picks it up.]</i>

</p>
</div>
<dl><dd><i>[Jeffery attaches Nibbler's new tooth with a laser.]</i>

<div class="poem">
<p><b>Jeffery</b>: Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
</p>
</div>
<dl><dd><i>[Fry laughs.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<div class="poem">
<p><b>Fry</b>: Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
</p>
