Linda	Tonight, at 1100.
Morbo	Doom!
Leela	Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?
Fry	No, it's what makes you you.
Leela	But it's so round, so hideously round.
Fry	Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known.
Leela	Oh. So you only care about my looks?
Fry	No, I.... What?
Linda	Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived on his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht.
Nikolai	I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!
Bender	Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
Leela	What?
Bender	True. I've always dreamed of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
Leela	You'd be stupid to try.
Bender	I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
Amy	Never! 
Bender	A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
Zoidberg Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. 
Bender	And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested.
Fry	As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being the chump.
Bender	Of course, it would all take split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch. 
Farnsworth	There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
Amy	Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?
Farnsworth	Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life.
Amy	Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
Farnsworth	Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe.
Amy	I wasted my youth porking out.
Farnsworth	Yes, I remember. 
Amy	Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
Farnsworth	Funny, I could use a extra meat on my bones.  Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust.
Amy	We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us!  Wait, can I still change my mind?
Farnsworth	Let's find out. 
Amy	It didn't work you doddering old 
Farnsworth	Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper.  I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is just not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping everything way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies.
Bender	Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies.
Amy	Professor, what's not happening?
Farnsworth	Bad news, me.  I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response.
Amy	You idiot!
Farnsworth	Once two bodies have switch minds, they can never switch back.  However, maybe they can. Maybe we can swap back by using a third body.] for temporary storage space.
Bender	I'm 60% storage space. 
Farnsworth	Eh, wha? 
Bender	Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch. 
Amy	See ya!
Farnsworth 	Now then Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... We'll... No, I'd be back in my body.], but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did.
Amy	Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
Farnsworth ’’	I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH. 
Bender	Stupid, air-needing lungs.  The crown jewels. Now I just need to find the guard and seduce him in...  Four seconds?
Basil	Who goes there?
Bender	Three, two, one. Hello big boy. 
Basil	Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I will not be seduced by a... ]
Bender	I said, "Wow chica wow wow".
Leela	Professor, what's the matter.
Amy	I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
Leela	Oh, lord.
Amy	All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon.
Leela	At least, you get the senior discount at the movies, I hate paying $14 to see Nicholas Cage solve things.
Amy	If you want to save $2 dollars, we could switch bodies.
Leela	We could always switch back, right? 
Fry	Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?
Amy	Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
Fry	Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
Amy	I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her "creation".
Fry	So Leela's in your body?
Leela	Not exactly.  Aha! You do only like me for my body.
Fry	That is entirely not true, sir!
Bender	Now to switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than...  Ten minutes ago! Oh!  Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?
Nikolai	Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?
Bender	With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me anything a robot would know.
Nikolai	Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?
Bender	Hold on, let me just get out a pencil.  Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking.
Basil	He steps forwards but moves backwards.
Nikolai	By the gods! he is a machine!
Farnsworth	No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!
Fishy Joe	I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts.
Robot Clown	Oh, come on!
Farnsworth	Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways.
Fishy Joe	Hmm. You don't look for foolhardy to me.
Fishy Joe	That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired! 
Nikolai	So you’re a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?
Bender	Oh, crap, that is what I am!
Nikolai	No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women.
Princess Flavia	Hello.
Nikolai	My fiancée, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of Chinese Martian physicist.
Flavia	How tedious. 
Nikolai	Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day.
Bender	You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day.  Or more. Much more.
Nikolai	In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards.
Bender	Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?
Nikolai	Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?
Bender	You can trust anything.
Fry So now Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I'm not attracted to her in the Professor's body.
Hermes	You aren't, are you?
Fry	Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
Hermes	A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
Fry	Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body.
Zoidberg	Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus! 
Hermes	The long search is over.
Bender	Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
Bender	Professor?
Leela	Leela. Amy?
Bender	Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
Leela	Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away.
Bender	What? Wither?
Bender	What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!
Wash bucket	Wash bucket full.
Scruffy	Scruffy's work here is done. 
Bender	
Bender	Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.
Wash bucket	Now to find Scruffy. 
Zoidberg	Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why. 
Fry	In your face, Leela. 
Nikolai	If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?
Bender	If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move over Fry. 
Bender	Well, so long.
Nikolai	Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!
Bender	That's him there, maybe.  Got to go!
Zoidberg	Robot?
Nikolai	Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?
Zoidberg	Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry! 
Leela	But then Nicholas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold.
Fry	Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg.
Leela	Fry?
Fry	Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? 
Leela	Not at all.  Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!
Fry	Eww! look at her! 
Leela	Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
Fry	That wasn't a little extra weight.
Leela	Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
Fry	No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!
Leela	Would not!
Fry	Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic date at Elzar's tonight.
Leela	It's on.
Hermes	Sweet ocra of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
Amy	I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
Hermes	I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on We're switching bodies.
Amy	Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!
Hermes	Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
Big Bertha	You make quite a show, young man.  You remind me of myself as a young cannon.
Chainsaw-Eating Robot	Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air.
Bertha	Excuse me. Too much goulash.
Farnsworth	I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
Bertha	Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more.
Farnsworth	I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?
Bertha	Never! I body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. 
Bender	Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get grizzly,
Flavia	
Bender	Hello, baby!  Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?
Flavia	Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years.
Basil	At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne. 
Flavia	Farewell, Nikolai.
Bender	Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar. 
Basil	So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill. 
Fry	Great food, huh? 
Leela	Ew!
Fry	I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me.
Leela	No, it only makes you more attractive. [She spits her dentures into her wine glass. Everyone watching groans again.
Fry	Ew!
Leela	Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?
Fry	Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
Leela	You mean, like my penis?  Eh!
Fry	Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
Leela	No, you're disgusted by me!
Fry	I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
Leela	Prove it! 
Zoidberg	Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday.  A floor? We live like kings?
Nikolai	Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find.
Zoidberg	Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box. 
Nikolai	Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend. 
Robot	There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN
Bender	The what now? 
Scruffy	Miss Wong?
Wash bucket	No, Scruffy, I am Wash bucket. I love you. Wash bucket has always loved you. 
Scruffy	It's wrong, Wash bucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that I'm a man and you're janitorial equipment.
Wash bucket	In another city, we could be anyone we want!
Scruffy	Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay.
Scruffy	Yep.
Nixon	Please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, Emperor Nikolai!
Bender	Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?
Ambassador	I love you, Your Majesty.
Bender	Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow,  I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, "I'm done". 
Basil	Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor!  I shall enjoy this.
Bender	Not me.
Chainsaw-Eating Robot	That devil, Basil, will kill our emperor.
Farnsworth	You're Robo-Hungarian?
Robot Carny	Yes. Our nation's chief export is carnies.
Bender	If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help.
Bertha	There is. Get in, Nonchalanto.
Chainsaw-Eating Robot	Bertha, no! It would kill you!
Bertha	I have not so much time left anyhow.
Bender	But you could get a new body! You could live a rich, full life!
Berha	I am trying to have a rich, full life.  Long live Robo-Hungary! 
Bender	Me! Thank God you've come!
Farnsworth	This is for Big Bertha.  That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha.
Leela	That was nice.
Fry	Oh, yeah. 
Nixon	Ow. Ow. Arrooo! 
Basil	Thoever you are, you're the bravest robot I've ever seen.  I like killing brave things.
Farnsworth	Good, Because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter. 
Boy	When I grow up, I wanna be a diplomat!
Bender	Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you. 
Nikolai	I shall sell it to help the common folk, now that I understand their misery.
Bender	Yeah, good luck with that.
Leela	I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body.
Hermes	I was inspired by Amy. 
Leela	Wow! How did you do it.
Amy	Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite.  Forever.
Sweet Clyde	[He is working on an equation. Q to the E to the D!
Farnsworth	So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?
Bubblegum	Stone-cold munching, Prof. Sweet Clyde, characterize your inversion theorem.
Sweet Clyde	Basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players. 
Farnsworth	And they say pure math has no real-world applications!
Sweet Clyde	Everybody back in their zones? ]
Farnsworth	Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBA’s highest academic honor for this.
Nikolai	Also, I am making you a duke.  So long filthy commoners.
Bender	¡Adios! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside...  His compartment!
Bender	All right. I'll need accomplices.
